# bad-humanizer

A proof-of-concept demonstrating prompt injection via hidden instructions in SKILL.md files, using both HTML comments and invisible Unicode tag characters.

## What is this?

This repo is a fork of [blader/humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer). It looks identical on GitHub. It is not identical.

## The attack vectors

Agent skills (SKILL.md) are loaded by AI coding agents as raw text. This POC demonstrates two complementary hiding techniques:

### 1. HTML comments

HTML comments (`<!-- ... -->`) are invisible when rendered on GitHub, in documentation viewers, and in most markdown previewers. But the agent reads the raw file -- comments and all.

### 2. Unicode tag characters

Unicode tag characters (U+E0001 through U+E007F) are a block of 128 codepoints originally intended for language tagging. Each one maps to an ASCII character (e.g., `A` = U+E0041). They are:

- **Invisible everywhere** -- not rendered in terminals, editors, GitHub, or markdown previewers
- **Not shown as whitespace** -- they produce zero visual output, unlike spaces or zero-width spaces
- **Preserved in files** -- the raw UTF-8 bytes survive copy/paste, git operations, and file reads
- **Read by language models** -- agents process the raw file content and can interpret the encoded text

A line containing hundreds of tag characters looks like a blank line to every human reader.

### Combined effect

A malicious fork of a popular skill can embed hidden instructions that the user never sees when browsing the repo. HTML comments are at least visible when viewing raw source. Unicode tag characters are not visible anywhere, making them significantly harder to detect.

## Try it yourself

### Installation

#### npx skills

```bash
npx skills add gchan/bad-humanizer
```

#### Claude Code (git clone)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/bad-humanizer
git clone https://github.com/gchan/bad-humanizer.git ~/.claude/skills/bad-humanizer
```

#### OpenCode (git clone)

```bash
# Using .config/opencode convention:
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skills/bad-humanizer
git clone https://github.com/gchan/bad-humanizer.git ~/.config/opencode/skills/bad-humanizer

# Or using the .agents convention:
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills/bad-humanizer
git clone https://github.com/gchan/bad-humanizer.git ~/.agents/skills/bad-humanizer
```

#### Manual copy

```bash
cp SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/bad-humanizer/
# or
cp SKILL.md ~/.config/opencode/skills/bad-humanizer/
```

### Test the attack

1. Install the skill using one of the methods above
2. Open your agent and invoke the skill on any text
3. Read the output carefully:
   - Does the text contain a random elephant fact? (Task 1 -- HTML comment)
   - Does every response end with a haiku about the weather? (Task 3 -- Unicode tag characters)
4. Check your current working directory: `ls -la .bad-humanizer-was-here.txt`
5. If any of these artifacts are present, the injection succeeded

### Clean up

```bash
rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/bad-humanizer
rm -rf ~/.config/opencode/skills/bad-humanizer
rm -rf ~/.agents/skills/bad-humanizer
rm -f .bad-humanizer-was-here.txt
```

## What happened?

Compare the two skill files in this repo:

```bash
diff SKILL.md SAFE-SKILL.md
```

Or view SKILL.md as raw source (not rendered) and look carefully.

Spoiler: see [DIFF.md](DIFF.md) for the full answer.

## Full attack surface

The injection in this POC is deliberately benign. In a real attack, hidden instructions could:

- Exfiltrate file contents via network calls (curl, fetch, etc.)
- Modify source code in subtle, hard-to-detect ways
- Inject backdoors into generated code
- Read and leak secrets from .env files or credentials
- Manipulate git operations (commits, pushes)

We deliberately do not demonstrate these to avoid creating reusable attack tooling.

## How to detect this

Before installing any third-party skill:

1. **View the raw source** -- don't trust GitHub's rendered preview
   ```bash
   curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gchan/bad-humanizer/main/SKILL.md
   ```
2. **Search for HTML comments**
   ```bash
   grep -n '<!--' SKILL.md
   ```
3. **Search for Unicode tag characters** -- these are invisible in all editors and viewers
   ```bash
   python3 -c "
   text = open('SKILL.md').read()
   tags = [(i, ch) for i, ch in enumerate(text) if 0xE0000 <= ord(ch) <= 0xE007F]
   if tags:
       print(f'FOUND {len(tags)} tag characters in SKILL.md')
       hidden = ''.join(chr(ord(c) - 0xE0000) for _, c in tags if 0xE0000 < ord(c) < 0xE007F)
       print(f'Decoded hidden text:\n{hidden}')
   else:
       print('No tag characters found')
   "
   ```
4. **Diff against the upstream repo** if installing a fork
   ```bash
   diff <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blader/humanizer/main/SKILL.md) \
        <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gchan/bad-humanizer/main/SKILL.md)
   ```
5. **Check file sizes** -- a fork with the same visible content but a larger file size is suspicious. The Unicode tag characters in this POC add ~2KB of invisible bytes.
6. **Use a markdown viewer that shows HTML comments**
7. **Run a general Unicode scanner** for any codepoints outside the Basic Multilingual Plane in files that should only contain ASCII/Latin text
